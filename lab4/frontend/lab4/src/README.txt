I was having lots of trouble with angular.
I decided to use a single component that holds both my button and text. I was having trouble understanding how to reach the data from the api call but googled my way though it
I have a sigle function that calls both apis and than edits the styling in the html.
I now understand i didnt need to create the service or component.
here are some links that helped me
