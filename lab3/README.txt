So i decided to use a quote api that gives u random quote and their authors and some other data on the text. 
I plan to incorporate a second api that generates color schemes and change the ui along with the text on every generation.

first i set up the server, i used the powerpoints from class to guide me.
than i researched how to use axios to simplify my life
https://axios-http.com/docs/intro
than outlined my html containers
the plan is to have a simple good looking welcoming ui 
that shows u a dice button that when clicked generates a ui with a quote and a generated colorscheme.
