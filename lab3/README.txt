So i decided to use a quote api that gives u random quote and their authors and some other data on the text. 
I plan to incorporate a second api that generates color schemes and change the ui along with the text on every generation.

first i set up the server, i used the powerpoints from class to guide me.
than i researched how to use node-fetch to simplify my life
https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-fetch
than outlined my html containers
