Prior to Starting the Lab I had to fix my Lab4. It worked on my end while working but seemed to not work after.
I decided to start from scrath and refresh with some tutorials. This one helped immensly

i installed 
express and axios via npm install
I used these api calls

https://api.fisenko.net/v1/quotes/en/random
I created a component to hold my main content - the quote and button
and a seperate component for the data base calls for Part 3.
 with the quote component i created a function that gets called on button click that alters quote text and color scheme by calling my 
 node server endpoints.

 I than started to do some research on mongodb
 I am struggling with how to connect mongodb efficiently

i feel like this lab needed more time.
